# TMDL-Net
Thyroid Multimodal Deep Learning Net, the Multimodal Deep Learning based Transformer for Thyroid Cancer Latral Lymph Node Metastasis Risk Stratification in Ultrasound Imaging

## Code


## Data


## Result
We have provided a thyroid LLNM (lateral lymph node metastasis) prediction 3d model based on locational information. Please see the webpage: ThyroidLLNM.html.

We visualized the focus points of TMDL-Net on the basis of Saliency for location information, registered a large amount of data, and statistically analyzed the model prediction heatmaps based on location information. We then established a model of metastasis probability distribution in three-dimensional space.
